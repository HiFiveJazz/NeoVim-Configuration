### Project

# Dependencies
This project requires neovim. Install via your preferred package manager.
***Arch Linux***
`sudo pacman -S neovim`

My config also comes with some languages that are installed via Mason, some of which require Npm to install. If you wish to use any of the languages I use, download Npm, or change the lpsconfig.lua after installation.

Install via your preferred package manager.

***macOS***
`brew install npm`
